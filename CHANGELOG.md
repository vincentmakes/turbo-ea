# Changelog

All notable changes to Turbo EA are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [0.19.0] - 2026-02-26

### Added
- Bundled Ollama container in Docker Compose for turnkey AI metadata suggestions — no external LLM setup required
- Auto-configuration of AI settings on startup when the bundled Ollama is present (`AI_AUTO_CONFIGURE=true`)
- Background model pull on first startup (default: `gemma3:4b`) with persistent volume so models survive restarts

## [0.18.0] - 2026-02-26

### Added
- AI-powered metadata suggestions for cards: search the web and use a local LLM (Ollama) to propose description, vendor, status, and other field values when creating or editing cards
- Three web search provider options: DuckDuckGo (default, zero-config), Google Custom Search API, and SearXNG (self-hosted)
- Admin settings panel for AI configuration: enable/disable, LLM provider URL, model selection, search provider, and per-card-type enablement
- AI suggest button on card detail page header for populating metadata on existing cards
- New `ai.suggest` permission key for controlling access to AI suggestions

## [0.17.4] - 2026-02-25

### Changed
- Redesigned card detail header badges for a cleaner, more harmonious look: smaller data quality ring, outlined chips with colored dots, and merged approval status badge with action menu into a single interactive chip

## [0.17.3] - 2026-02-25

### Security
- Moved JWT storage from sessionStorage to httpOnly cookies, preventing JavaScript access to authentication tokens (CWE-922)
- Added `POST /auth/logout` endpoint to clear the auth cookie server-side

### Fixed
- Login session no longer lost on page refresh

## [0.17.2] - 2026-02-24

### Security
- Suppressed implicit exception chaining on all ServiceNow endpoint error responses to prevent potential stack trace exposure (CWE-209)

## [0.17.1] - 2026-02-24

### Fixed
- Hidden successor/lineage relation types from admin Card Type drawer, Relation Types tab, and metamodel graph since they are already managed via the Lineage toggle
- Limited the Add Relation dialog on card detail pages to only show relation types not already visible as dedicated sections

## [0.17.0] - 2026-02-24

### Added
- Visible and Mandatory toggles per relation type in the Card Type admin drawer, configurable independently for source and target sides
- Visible/mandatory relation types are always displayed on card detail pages, even when empty
- Inline add button per relation type group on card detail pages for faster relation creation without a generic dialog
- Required badge on mandatory relation types in card detail view

### Changed
- Redesigned Relations section on card detail pages with grouped card-style layout and per-relation-type inline search

## [0.16.2] - 2026-02-24

### Security
- Fixed exception information exposure in ServiceNow integration endpoints — all external service calls now catch exceptions and return sanitized error messages instead of leaking internal details
- Fixed unhandled httpx exception in SSO token exchange that could expose the identity provider URL and tenant ID on network failures

## [0.16.1] - 2026-02-24

### Security
- Fixed remaining information exposure through exceptions in calculation engine, ServiceNow sync, and EOL proxy endpoints — error responses no longer leak internal exception details

## [0.16.0] - 2026-02-24
### Added
- Successor / Predecessor relationships: new `has_successors` toggle on card types enables a dedicated Lineage section on card detail pages
- Built-in successor relation types for Application, IT Component, Initiative, Platform, Business Process, Interface, and Data Object card types
- Admin UI toggle and card layout support for the Lineage section
-
## [0.15.3] - 2026-02-24

### Security
- Fixed incomplete HTML sanitization in PortalViewer and SoAW export — replaced regex-based tag stripping with DOMParser for safe text extraction
- Fixed DOM-based XSS in SoAW PDF export — user-controlled values are now HTML-escaped before interpolation into document.write
- Moved JWT token from sessionStorage to in-memory storage to prevent exfiltration via XSS accessing browser storage APIs
- Fixed ReDoS vulnerability in calculation engine — replaced polynomial regex with string-based assignment parsing
- Fixed path traversal in BPM template endpoint — template keys are now validated and resolved paths are confined to the template directory
- Fixed information exposure in ServiceNow connection test, calculation test, and formula validation endpoints — error responses no longer leak internal exception details

## [0.15.1] - 2026-02-24

### Fixed
- Hardcoded English strings in report filter/legend areas (Portfolio, Capability Map, Lifecycle) now use i18n translation keys
- Report filter dropdowns (group-by, color-by, field filters, option labels, color legends) now resolve metamodel field and option translations for the current locale, falling back to the entity key when no translation exists
- Cost report field and group-by dropdowns now resolve metamodel translations; replaced hardcoded "Unspecified" with localized fallback

## [0.15.0] - 2026-02-24

### Added
- Admin-configurable enabled languages setting under General Settings — controls which locales are available in the language picker and translation dialog
- Alembic migration to backfill English translations from label fields into the translations JSONB
- Seed helper to auto-inject English translations so `en` is treated as a first-class locale

### Changed
- Translation architecture: English is now stored in translations JSONB alongside all other locales, rather than implicitly in the label column
- Metamodel label resolution falls back to the entity key when no translation exists for the current locale, instead of always showing the English label
- TranslationDialog now shows all enabled locales (including English) and uses the entity key as reference instead of the English label
- Metamodel form fields (type label, field label, etc.) now save against the admin's current UI locale
- Removed all inline translation accordions from FieldEditorDialog, CardLayoutEditor, StakeholderRolePanel, and MetamodelAdmin — translations are managed exclusively via the centralized TranslationDialog
- Language picker in the nav bar is filtered to only show admin-enabled locales

### Fixed
- SoAW editor displaying "Part I: Part I: Statement of Architecture Work" — removed duplicate Part prefix from section headers

### Added
- Translation checklist in CLAUDE.md to ensure all new content includes i18n translations
- Comprehensive i18n test suites for both frontend (locale file completeness, interpolation, plurals, resolveLabel) and backend (seed data translation coverage for all types, subtypes, sections, fields, options, relations)

### Changed
- Moved "Manage Translations" button to the TypeDetailDrawer header bar for quicker access

### Fixed
- Seed metamodel now merges translations into existing built-in types on upgrade (subtypes, sections, fields, and options were missing translations in pre-existing instances)
- Icon field alignment in TypeDetailDrawer first row

## [0.14.1] - 2026-02-23

### Added
- Dedicated TranslationDialog for managing all metamodel translations (type labels, subtypes, sections, fields, options) in a single focused dialog with locale tabs and completion badges

- CLAUDE.md documentation for i18n conventions and step-by-step guide for adding new languages

### Fixed
- Invalid JSON in Chinese locale files caused by unescaped double quotes (replaced with CJK corner brackets `「」`)

## [0.13.0] - 2026-02-23

### Added
- Metamodel translation support: card types, relation types, and stakeholder roles now store per-locale translations in a JSONB `translations` column
- Admin UI translation inputs in TypeDetailDrawer, FieldEditorDialog, StakeholderRolePanel, and CardLayoutEditor for managing label translations across all supported locales
